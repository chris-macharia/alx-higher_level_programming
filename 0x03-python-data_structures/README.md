# Data Structures in Python
## Lists
Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values.<br>
The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.<br>
Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.<br>

* Happy Coding!!!
