# Higher level programming
* So far we have used lower level languages which interact with the computer system at a very low level.<br>
* Think of something like memory management, which we (as the programmers had to do manually).<br>

* What if we could abstract some of the low level stuff and only focus on simplicity of the programming language?<br>
* **Python** is one of the most abstracted languages and offers pure bliss as a programming tool.<br>

* The argument here is that if you can easily interact with the tool, then you can easily be a deadly warrior.<br>
* Have fun with python and remember, now that your new weapon is easy to master, it is super easy to gain skill and easily take down the biggest of monsters<br>
** Let's see what you got ;-)<br>

* HAPPY CODING!!!
