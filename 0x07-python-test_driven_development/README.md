# Test Driven Development in Python
There are 3 rules to follow in test driven developments:<br>
* You are not allowed to write any production code until you have written its failing tests<br>
* You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation 
failures are failures<br>
* You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit 
test<br>
    * Happy Coding!!!
